VCS
===

VCS is a wrapper for version control systems.  It presents an
essentially uniform interface to the user, allowing 'muscle memory' to
use vcs commands rather than adapt to the version control system
currently in use.

Currently Bazaar, CVS and Subversion are supported, with a small set
of commands.  More version control systems and more commands will,
hopefuly, be added in the future.

Installation
============

To build VCS, you will need:
  GNU C++      http://gcc.gnu.org/
  cURL         http://curl.haxx.se/
  Expat        http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Use the following commands:
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Read 'man vcs' for documentation.


Feedback
========

control system to Richard Kettlewell <richard+vcs@sfere.greenend.org.uk>.
