VCS
===

VCS is a wrapper for version control systems.  It presents an
essentially uniform interface to the user, allowing 'muscle memory' to
use vcs commands rather than adapt to the version control system
currently in use.

Bazaar, Git, CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Darcs and Perforce are
supported, with a small set of commands.  More version control systems
and more commands will, hopefuly, be added in the future.

Installation
============

To build VCS, you will need:
  GNU C++      http://gcc.gnu.org/
  cURL         http://curl.haxx.se/
  Expat        http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Use the following commands:
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Read 'man vcs' for documentation.


Using configure
===============

See 'INSTALL' for generic instructions.  Options specific to this
package are:

  ./configure --without-werror
    Suppresses use of the -Werror option.  This is useful (for
    instance) if your platform generates warnings for its own header
    files.
