VCS
===

VCS is a wrapper for version control systems.  It presents an
essentially uniform interface to the user, allowing 'muscle memory' to
use vcs commands rather than adapt to the version control system
currently in use.

Bazaar, Git, CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Darcs, Perforce, RCS and SCCS
are supported, with a small set of commands.  See the man page for
more details.

Installation
============

To build VCS, you will need:
  GNU C++      http://gcc.gnu.org/
  cURL         http://curl.haxx.se/
  Expat        http://expat.sourceforge.net/

Use the following commands:
  ./configure
  make
  sudo make install

Read 'man vcs' for documentation.


Using configure
===============

See 'INSTALL' for generic instructions.  Options specific to this
package are:

  ./configure --without-werror
    Suppresses use of the -Werror option.  This is useful (for
    instance) if your platform generates warnings for its own header
    files.

  ./configure --with-gcov
    Enable coverage testing.  Only useful for developers.
