vcs (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * If you quit a pager (configured with VCS_PAGER for instance) before
    some slow underyling command has finished executing, vcs should now
    exit immediately rather than waiting for the subprocess to complete.
  * For Perforce support:
    - Filenames containing @, %, # and * should now be properly encoded
      and decoded.
    - If you try to vcs add a directory to Perforce, it will be silently
      ignored.
    - vcs status now shows files opened for delete and supports
      "incomplete" client views (i.e. which don't cover every possible
      filename below the client root) properly.
    - vcs commit should now work for all four combinations of a message
      being present or not and a list of files being present or not (issue
      #2).
  * vcs up will invoke bzr up in a bound branch (created with bzr
    checkout) and bzr pull in any other branch.
  * vcs revert now supports Subversion back to 1.3 (previously it would
    misparse output from 1.3 and 1.4). A possible hang was also removed.
  * Improved support for older versions of Git and fixed vcs status with
    Git.
  * vcs clone now recognizes Mercurial's static-http: scheme.
  * Improved support for older Mercurial versions.
  * Improved support for CVS conflicts.
  * Needs Expat.
