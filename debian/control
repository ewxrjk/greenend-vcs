Description: Wrapper for version control systems giving a uniform interface
 VCS is a wrapper for version control systems.  It presents an
 essentially uniform interface to the user, allowing 'muscle memory' to
 use vcs commands rather than adapt to the version control system
 currently in use.
 .
 Currently Bazaar, Git, CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Darcs and Perforce
 are supported, with a small set of commands.
