Description: Wrapper for version control systems giving a uniform interface
 VCS is a wrapper for version control systems.  It presents an
 essentially uniform interface to the user, allowing 'muscle memory' to
 use vcs commands rather than adapt to the version control system
 currently in use.
 .
 Currently Bazaar, CVS and Subversion are supported, with a small set
 of commands.  More version control systems and more commands will,
 hopefuly, be added in the future.
