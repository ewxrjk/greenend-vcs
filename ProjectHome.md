Do you find yourself typing bzr commit in Git branches, or cvs diff in your Perforce workspace? Then perhaps VCS is for you.

VCS is a wrapper for version control systems. It presents an essentially uniform interface to the user, allowing ‘muscle memory’ to use vcs commands rather than adapt to the version control system currently in use. Of course, the downside is that you have yet another three-letter command to start using!

The supported systems are Bazaar, Git, CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, Darcs and Perforce. More could be added. The supported commands are add, annotate (blame), clone, commit, diff, edit, log, remove, revert, status, update. Again, more could be added.
